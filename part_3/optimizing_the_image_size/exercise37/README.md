Tried to optimize it with using official alpine images. 

Frontend -> Official alpine images gives us better results then building from scratch in Ubuntu. TODO: Try using alpine
Backend -> Building image from scrach gives us an option to delete go package which lowers it's size from official alpine image by ~50%
